 PEP 3153: the protocols PEP formerly known as async-pep
=========================================================

This is the open collaborative repository for the draft `Python Enhancement
Proposal`_ for getting standardized protocol abstractions into the Python
standard library.

Work on this PEP was originally started by Jim Fulton, with help from Glyph
Lefkowitz and JP Calderone of Twisted Matrix Laboratories. It is currently
being championed by lvh, also of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, under the
watchful eye of Glyph and JP.

Outside contributions are most welcome! The goal is to make the threshold to
collaboration minimal. Please feel free to add tickets, or even better, submit
pull requests.
